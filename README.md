# Challenge-1---Horiseon
Challenge 1 assignement
This is a website that was full of divs and non-descriptive tags
I adjusted all relevent tags with the appropriate semantic tags to make the html doc more readable
there were minor mistakes that needed to be corrected on the html and css docs
I had to add alt tags, add an id, and delete an extra image closing tag from the html doc
I made a small change to a class on the css doc
